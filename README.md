## BEFORE YOU PROCEED
* ##### ⚠️ MAIN NOTICE! The manufacturer changed the brand of the BIOS chip to MXIC 25L128 (Macronix) but didn't change the software for this chip, so the update is only possible with the programmer device.
* ##### ⚠️ Check your motherboard revision! This firmware only for motherboards witn nuvoTon NCT5567D-B, 2021 release!
* ##### ⚠️ If you ignored the warning above and flashed your BIOS using firmware update software, please don't create issues, read the instructions carefully and get a programmer device as stated!
* ##### ⚠️ In some cases, it is required to clear CMOS data, for that, you must unplug all power cables to the motherboard and remove the CMOS battery. This is due to the lack of standardization of chinese motherboard manufacturers.
